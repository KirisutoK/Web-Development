          <h1>My Story</h1>
          <section>
            <p style="text-indent: 10%;"> I grew up in the Philippines, and during middle school, I was known as a
              creative, smart, and cooperative student. I had many friends and was well-connected through my family's
              social circle. </p>
            <p> When I was 8 years old, my mom moved to America and later remarried, starting a new chapter with a
              blended family. Fast forward to high school, I consistently ranked at the top of my class and often led
              group projects, earning a reputation as someone reliable, quick-witted, calm under pressure, and capable
              of leadership. Eventually, my mom called to let me know that I, along with my siblings, would be moving to
              America to live with her. </p>
            <p> After arriving, I enrolled at Waterloo High School, where I continued to stay cooperative, focused, and
              eager to learn. I made it a priority to adapt to the new environment and culture, paying attention to the
              small details from communication styles to social behavior so I could adjust, connect, and grow. </p>
            <p> After graduating from Waterloo High School with a 3.5 GPA, I was preparing to join the U.S. Air Force.
              It had been a goal I held onto for a long time, but just before enlistment, my medical records revealed
              that I had an allergic reaction to shellfish. Even though I had no trouble eating it, I was still required
              to carry an EpiPen, and that small detail was enough to close the door on my opportunity to serve. </p>
            <p> At first, it felt like the path I had worked hard for had suddenly disappeared. But instead of letting
              that moment define me, I decided to move forward. </p>
            <p> I enrolled at Finger Lakes Community College, determined to make the most of this new chapter. What
              began as a disappointment turned into a blessing, I discovered new skills, gained knowledge I never
              expected, and learned how to adapt in the face of setbacks. In the process, I grew stronger, more
              disciplined, and more confident in carving my own path toward the future. </p>

          <h1>My Ambition</h1>
          <section>
            <p style="text-indent: 10%;"> I aspire to build a successful career in IT and technology-driven fields,
              aiming to earn a six-figure income while continuously developing my skills and creativity. I am eager to
              collaborate with colleagues, connect with clients and staff, and contribute to innovative projects. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 10%;"> My goal is to secure a stable position that allows me to grow professionally,
              to emerging technologies, and stay ahead in the ever-evolving job market. With God guiding my path, I am
              committed to embracing challenges, seizing opportunities, and walking the road to success with faith,
              resilience, and purpose. </p>
